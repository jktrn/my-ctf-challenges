### Description

> During his sophomore year of high school, enscribe made a really bad osu!catch clone for his final project in his Exploring Computer Science class. It was his first time on Unity, but it has some charm to it!
> 
> Receive an SS (with maximum score) on "Bakamitai", the hardest map, to receive the flag. Shouldn't be too difficult, right?
> 
> Note: An SS is not enough! The remote has additional checks for specific scoring (the maximum score if SS'ed "legitimately").
> 
> Note: This executable is built for x86 Windows.
