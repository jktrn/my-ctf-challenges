### Description #2

> #### Mar 2, 2023
>
> I am completely, utterly, unconditionally infatuated with Kohane Azusawa.  
> Today, her birthday banner just dropped.
>
> I've topped out all my credit cards.  
> I've cashed out on my index funds and sold my car.  
> I've sacrificed my vitamins, my social life, my sanity—all for a glimpse of that sweet, sweet **「Happy Birthday！！2023 - こはね 小豆沢」** limited-edition birthday card.
>
> But alas, it's never enough. The odds are miniscule, the rates are rigged, the gacha system is a predatory sham.<br>
> It feels like I've pulled a million times and I still haven't gotten her! Do the gacha gods not pity me?!<br><br>
