# Fall Guys: Perfect Match
Making Fall Guys' Perfect Match in Unity.

# What
This repo just hosts the end result of the Fall Guys Perfect Match recreation. I want to stress that this code is in no way optimised and could be written to be a lot more efficient, it was made to just work. I am not a Unity Expert / well versed in building Unity applications but just wanted to make something fun.

# Going Forward
This could be amended to be more difficult, by adding more fruit, rounds and messing with time constraints etc 

If anyone is thinking of recreating a Fall Guys level, break it down into a number of small tasks and focus on those as opposed to looking at the level as a whole.
